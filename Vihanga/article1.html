                    More than a decade after it came into effect, EVAW has helped facilitate a rise in both reporting and investigations of violent crimes against women and girls, and, to a lesser extent, convictions of those responsible. With the support and funding of international donors, the Afghan government established specialized police units called “Family Response Units,” prosecution offices, and special courts with female judges to carry out the EVAW law. Particularly in urban areas, women have seen growing awareness of the law and improvements in the way judicial institutions respond to EVAW cases.
                   </p>
                   <p>But as the opposition armed group, the Taliban, have made territorial gains, the prospect of a Taliban-dominated government or descent into fragmented civil war threatens the existing constitutional order, including provisions guaranteeing women’s equality and the EVAW law.</p>
                   <p>This report is being released as the United States and other countries complete their troop withdrawals from Afghanistan, leaving uncertain the survival of the post-2001 Afghan state. In light of this, it is vital that Afghanistan’s international partners continue to support efforts to protect women and girls from violence and hold perpetrators to account. </p>
                   <p>The EVAW law, decreed by then-President Hamid Karzai in 2009 and reconfirmed by President Ashraf Ghani in 2018, makes 22 acts of abuse toward women criminal offenses, including rape, battery, forced marriage, preventing women from acquiring property, and prohibiting a woman or girl from going to school or work. The law has encountered considerable resistance from conservatives inside the Afghan judiciary and parliament but has also driven slow but genuine change and has become an advocacy lynchpin for the efforts of Afghan women’s rights groups to reform other laws. </p>
                   <p>Despite the gains since 2009, full implementation of the EVAW law remains elusive, with all actors involved—including police, prosecutors, and judges—often deterring women from filing complaints and pressing them to seek meditation within their family instead. Family pressure, financial dependence, stigma associated with filing a complaint, and fear of reprisals, including losing their children, have also deterred women from registering cases.</p>
                   <p>This report focuses on the experiences of Afghan women in their attempts to pursue justice through the EVAW process. It is based on 61 interviews between 2018 and 2021. We interviewed women and girls who had reported crimes that fell under the EVAW provisions, either directly to the police or to designated EVAW prosecution units in Kabul, Herat, Mazar-e Sharif, and Bamiyan. We also interviewed prosecutors involved in EVAW cases, judges from the special EVAW units, lawyers, legal aid providers, healthcare workers, and staff from nongovernmental organizations and other advocacy groups who have been involved in EVAW investigations, training, and reforms.  

                    From the moment an Afghan woman decides to file a complaint under the EVAW law, she faces resistance. If she files the complaint with the police, they are supposed to either take the complaint or refer her to the nearest EVAW investigation unit. However, in many cases involving violence from a male family member—often the husband—police discourage women from filing a case and pressure her to go home and reconcile.</p>
                    <p>Even if she manages to file a case, pressure or threats from relatives frequently compels women to withdraw cases before or after they reach the investigation stage. In most of these cases, the women do not have access to lawyers. Because the EVAW law provides that prosecution of most crimes must be based on a complaint that the victim, her family, or her attorney files, the case cannot proceed and is dropped if a complaint is withdrawn.  </p>
                    <p>Although mediation is often dangerous for women who are put at risk by being convinced to reconcile with their abuser, EVAW cases are commonly resolved through family mediation—often traditional informal councils, or jirgas. The EVAW law prohibits mediation in only five kinds of offenses against women: rape, forced sale of sex, publicizing the identity of a victim, burning or the use of chemical substances to cause harm, and forced self-immolation or suicide. For these offenses, even if the woman (or family member in the case of death) does not file a complaint, or tries to withdraw it, the state is obligated to prosecute. In all other cases, police and other officials can pressure the woman to have her case resolved through mediation.</p>
                    <p>In violation of the law, EVAW officials have sometimes referred cases to mediation when it is prohibited. Particularly outside major cities, officials often refer women and their relatives to traditional councils to resolve cases, including violent crimes, thereby bypassing the justice system altogether. This kind of mediation often leads to outcomes that deny women protection and justice and reinforces impunity, even for the most serious crimes.</p>
                    <p>Failure by police to arrest suspects is one of the most common reasons that cases do not progress. Police are particularly reluctant to arrest husbands accused of violence against their wives. Although conviction rates for murdering women have risen, this is not the case for so-called “honor killings,” when women and girls are killed by family members. While the revised 2018 penal code stipulates that “honor” is not a defense in a murder case, “honor killings” remain widespread. Particularly in rural areas, judicial authorities often condone them.</p>
                    <p>As cases move forward, complainants face additional obstacles. Lawyers told Human Rights Watch that, while awareness of the EVAW law has improved in recent years, police and prosecutors in many parts of Afghanistan still lack knowledge of the law or deliberately ignore it. One lawyer described the case of a woman who filed a complaint against her husband with the police and was later told it had been “lost” and never referred for investigation. There is no system in place to prevent police from interfering, or even removing, files. With competent legal counsel, some women have seen their violent husbands convicted and imprisoned, and sometimes also received monetary restitution—but these cases are the exception.</p>
                    <p>Throughout the process, women face additional risks of abuse. The EVAW law does not address so-called moral crimes under Sharia, Islamic law, under which most women and girls are prosecuted. Although the Afghan Supreme Court ruled in 2017 that “running away” from home was not a crime, women and girls who leave their homes—often fleeing domestic violence—are frequently charged with and prosecuted for moral crimes such as “attempted zina”—attempting to engage in sex outside marriage.

                        <p>Many women and girls who report violent crimes committed against them, including but not limited to sexual assault, describe being subjected to invasive and abusive vaginal and sometimes anal examinations for the purpose of determining virginity. Such “virginity tests” have no medical basis and the World Health Organization has stated that healthcare workers should never conduct examinations for this purpose. In Afghanistan, government doctors, frequently men, conduct these examinations, often without consent. They are not limited to rape cases, and often do not focus on whether forced intercourse had taken place. Reported “findings” are often accepted as evidence in court, contributing sometimes to long prison sentences for women and girls. Although Afghan human rights groups and some Afghan officials have advocated for an end to these “virginity tests,” their use remains widespread.</p>
                        <p>Afghanistan is on the brink of another transition; preserving the gains of the EVAW law and access to justice for women will be a critical test.

                            In July 2021 we provided Afghan government officials with a summary of our findings. On July 28, 2021, the Attorney General’s Office of Afghanistan provided a statement saying that it had not found any irregularities in the processing of EVAW cases but would raise our concerns in the government’s High Council on Violence against Women. It concurred that continued support from Afghanistan’s donors will be vital to preserving legal protections for women’s rights. (See Appendix.)</p>

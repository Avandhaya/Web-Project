                   <p>One of the most important developments for women in Afghanistan as part of the post-2001 reconstruction effort was the 2009 Elimination of Violence Against Women (EVAW) Law, created to provide women and girls with legal protection from domestic violence.</p>
                   <p>The report shows the obstacles Afghan women face as they attempt to pursue justice through the courts. Although families and police frequently deter women from registering complaints, the law has driven slow but genuine change for Afghan women.</p>
                   <p>Unfortunately, the law has not been fully implemented, but in a country like Afghanistan, where patriarchy has such deep roots, even having this law has been a huge achievement. It’s so important that the law is preserved.</p>
                    <p>Another victory for women was the 2004 constitution, which included for the first time in Afghanistan’s history a provision – article 22 – that men and women were equal, and there could be no discrimination on that basis. Up until then, my mother had never even been able to get a national identity card because women were not allowed to. Only my father could.</p>
                    <p>But now people fear that laws like EVAW and other advances in women’s rights will be in danger as the Taliban gain more power. </p> 
                    <p>The Afghan government claims to be protecting the gains achieved since 2001. They specifically say progress in women’s rights is one of those gains. But they have already failed to fully implement the EVAW Law. There are many people in the government who do not fully accept women’s rights.</p>     
                    <p>Yes, if the Taliban gain more power it is going to get harder. But now there is more legal infrastructure, many more educated women lawyers, and others who have been leading this fight. They are not going to stop, and they deserve support. This is not the time to walk away.</p>  
                    <p>Many members of parliament – men with very conservative mindsets – have opposed it, and so the law was issued by decree rather than going through parliament. The rules of men have defined Afghan society for a long time and this law is a challenge to that. Also, there is a lack of awareness among many women who don’t know they have rights and don’t know about the law. Others who may want to seek justice simply cannot afford to travel and take the time to report cases and see them through the justice system. And most women are financially dependent on their male relatives, so they can’t afford to file a complaint against someone on whom they depend for their very food and shelter.</p> 
                    <p>Also, there is a huge stigma about reporting domestic violence. There is a strong belief that such issues should not be brought up outside the home. And, of course, many do not trust the justice system. They see it as corrupt or lacking capacity and they don’t trust the police. And the police themselves do not understand or accept the law.</p>

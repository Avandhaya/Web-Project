       <h2>What rights are protected? </h2>
       <p>There are 16 basic rights protected by the Human Rights Act. As you would expect, they concern issues such as life, liberty and freedom from slavery and inhuman treatment. But they also cover rights that apply to everyday life, like what we can say and do, our beliefs and the right to marry and raise a family. </p>

       <h2>Who has to comply with the Human Rights Act?</h2>
       <p>The Act applies to:

<li>all public authorities (such as central government departments, local authorities and NHS Trusts), and </li>
<li>all other bodies whether public or private, performing public functions such as delivering publicly funded care and operating prisons.</li></p>
